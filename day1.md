# Welcome to Day 1 of the Clemson Game Coding Camp!

Every day we will have a GitHub repository page that outlines each day and the activities that we will complete.  We will also provide any homework on these pages.  Feel free to browse the other days to see what is coming up! We are so excited for this camp and look forward to teaching game development in a workshop style camp (We have have mini lessons every day and activities throughout our time together).  As always, let us know if you need any help or have any questions.
