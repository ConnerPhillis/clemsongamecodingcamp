# Welcome to Day 2 of the Clemson Game Coding Camp!

## Day 2: Game Mechanics

###	Agenda (Go over high level of the schedule for day 2)
-	Homework Review
 -	Everyone presents their game via screen sharing.
 -	Explain how to do screen sharing on Zoom.
-	Game Mechanics
-	Movement
- **Activity**: Create a character and make it respond to the gamepad (keyboard-based) (This will take awhile, we haven’t had them use makecode yet...)
-	Collisions (video example of a collision)
-	Example: Bullets
-	How does it work? What happens if it hits? Misses?
-	Mechanics
-	Reactions
-	Sensing collisions
-	Collisions with other players
-	Collisions with non-players e.g. walls
-	Player
-	Computer player
-	Randomness
-	AI
-	Rules
-	Scoring
-	Are all points worth the same?
-	Lives
-	How do players regenerate? 
-	How many lives do they get?
-	Where do they come back to life? Does the entire board get reset?
-	How does a player win?
-	Turn-taking
-	Can players and enemies do the same things?
-	Does the game speed change over time to make it easier/harder?
-	Feedback loops
-	Actions have a consequence
-	But not all consequences have to be life or death
-	E.g. Can I bump another player without killing him? 
-	E.g. What happens when I hit a wall?
-	Win more time, points, speed, access to extra levels.
-	Game State (define first)
- Whose turn is it?
-	What does each player carry?
-	How fast is the player moving? 
-	Is the player jumping, running, walking, flying, falling? 
-	Where are the other characters? 
-	How fast is the game running?
-	What constraints are there on the game play?
-	Activity: Reconstruct the game state 
-	We get out a chess board or monopoly board and put all the pieces in a legit configuration.
-	Each student writes down the state of the game for themselves.
-	We hide the board.
-	Each student pairs up with another to discuss their game state and create the union of their two descriptions.
-	One pair speaks up and tells us how to recreate the state of the board. 
-	We compare with the original and see what’s missing.
