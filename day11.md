# Welcome to Day 11 of the Clemson Game Coding Camp!
- Day 11 (Conner) APIs? I know a lot about those

## Permission (better title later???)
  - who is giving permission / who is being controlled

Try to figure out how to do this in some analytical way, analyze 

every bullet point, add how long you think it will take

Rank in order of interest
    prep two, prepared in case they go faster, skip the third

think pair share? - present with ethical issue and questions to address like the stuff in the following link

minors and age gated video games
Who are the players - kids, companies, lawmakers, etc...
  - who are the actors
  - what are the motivations for either side
  - who should win / must there be a winner, compromise???

what if the actors have disappeared

Come up with three or four questions like [this](https://andrewbegel.com/info461/activities/situating-software-organizations.html)

### Piracy
Copyright piracy is estimated to cost the [US economy $58 B / yr, 373,375 lost jobs](https://www.ipi.org/ipi_issues/detail/the-true-cost-of-copyright-industry-piracy-to-the-us-economy#:~:text=In%20this%20study%2C%20the%20total,billion%20in%20lost%20tax%20revenues.)
    
- Is it right to ever use a pirated version of a game?
  - To replace a lost copy
  - To get a preview without having to pay the full cost
- [The supreme court has ruled that minors are allowed to purchase games that are M rated](https://patch.com/california/coronado/supreme-court-rules-minors-can-purchase-violent-video-games), is it ethical to allow minors to view content that has been considered beyond their maturity level?
  - Are certain games more dangerous than others
    - GTA vs Call of Duty vs Halo
- How are ratings determined?
  
### Values

#### Capitalism
- Capitalism (buying things in a game)
  - Loot boxes
    - Should developers have the right to guard certain things behind paywalls?
    - [The Start Wars Battlefront Reboot](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2s-loot-box-controversy-expl/1100-6455155/)
    - Some people view these microtransactions as supporting developers, and say that because they are entirely optional they are fine
      - What if these items give other players an edge? (pay to win)

### Open Source
- Find videos of Open Source people
  - Youtube video explaining open source with legos.
    - start from a certain point
